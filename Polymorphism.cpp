C++ Polymorphism
Polymorphism
Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

For example, think of a base class called Animal that has a method called animalSound(). Derived classes of Animals could be Pigs, Cats, Dogs, Birds - And they also have their own implementation of an animal sound (the pig oinks, and the cat meows, etc.):

Example
// Base class
class Animal {
  public:
    void animalSound() {
      cout << "The animal makes a sound \n";
    }
};

// Derived class
class Pig : public Animal {
  public:
    void animalSound() {
      cout << "The pig says: wee wee \n";
    }
};

// Derived class
class Dog : public Animal {
  public:
    void animalSound() {
      cout << "The dog says: bow wow \n";
    }
};
